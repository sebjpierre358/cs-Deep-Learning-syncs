After one epoch, the accuracy of the model is
90.53%

The training takes ~4mins on my personal computer. I made sure to test the
model on a test python file that imports assignment.py and preprocess.py and
trains and tests, which also consistently produced a 90.53% accuracy.
I attempted to test on a dept machine and the accuracy decreased to ~10% each
time for some reason. Other than this, no bugs

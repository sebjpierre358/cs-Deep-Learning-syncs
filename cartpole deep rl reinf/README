HW6 - POLICY GRAD. RL

REINFORCE Train Time (Personal Machine):  ~3mins
          Average Last 50 Reward Totals:   +300

RWB Train Time (PC): >3mins
Avg Last 50 Reward: ~400

Previous versions of the model used 2 fully connected layers, and this ran
in a couple mins on desktop and performed great, but took +7 mins for the
autograder. Seems its not totally necessary for this RL task

Also, training curves for REINFORCE tend to ramp up to 500 really quick and
stays there with the a big dip in performance in between before recovering.
